### Hi there, I'm Rasmus ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Staff Site Reliability Engineer at [Vend](https://vend.com/).

#### My open-source projects

- [EventFlow](https://github.com/eventflow/EventFlow)
  EventFlow is a basic CQRS+ES framework for .NET designed to be easy to use.
- [Bake](https://github.com/rasmus/Bake)
  Bake is a convention based build command that I created to make it easier
  for myself to create small hobby projects
